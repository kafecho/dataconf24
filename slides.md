# Just enough Python :snake:

```Python
with tableau_server.auth.sign_in(tableau_auth):
    variables = {"projectName": os.environ.get('PROJECT_NAME')}
    query = open('resources/graphql/simple_lineage.graphql').read()

    ## This is the important bit below
    query_results = tableau_server.metadata.query(query, variables=variables)
    with open('simple_lineage.json', 'w') as f:
        json.dump(query_results, f)

# When Business complains :scream:

## The figures are incorrect!

## Data could be late?

## Data could be wrong?

---

# Operability

* Data quality checks (e.g. dbt tests)
* Slack alerts on failures
* Not so business friendly :cry:

---

# From checks to **labels**

# Sample dbt code

models:
  - name: tractor_sales

      - name: created_at

# Roll Your Own Linter

![bg right:70% w:70%](assets/roll-your-own-linter.png)

---

# Shift left: The effects of UI-driven work

### Time consuming to create | re-create

### Time consuming to verify

### Lack of audit trail

---

# Lack of release pipeline

### Less appreciation for segregated environments

### Dev work becomes productionised

### Self-serve vs dependable data

---

## Data Source As Code

![bg right:70% w:80%](assets/data-source-as-code.png)

# What it enables

### Improved quality: dev -> qa -> prod

### Common deployment patterns for reporting and data pipelines

### Audit trail

---

# To recap

---

# Tales from production

* Applied this thinking to our domain
* Easier to adopt for green field projects
* Many areas are ripe for automation
* **Ways of working** just as crucial

# Thank you!
